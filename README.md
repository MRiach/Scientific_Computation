# Scientific_Computation
Projects that formed part of my scientific computation coursework in my degree.

Project 1: Analysis and implementation of different sorting algorithms and modification of the Rabin-Karp algorithm which uses a rolling hash function in order to improve its speed

Project 2: Modifying breadth first and depth first search algorithms to efficiently solve weighted graph based problems with conditions on the number of times a node can be visited (e.g. train station problem) and solving a differential equation via simulation by using a random walk on a Laplacian graph

Project 3: Using principal component analysis to reconstruct a dataset from its reduced form and implementing a compact finite difference scheme to compute finite difference approximations with fractal dimensions being used to measure the chaos of dynamical systems

Across all three projects, first class honours was obtained.
